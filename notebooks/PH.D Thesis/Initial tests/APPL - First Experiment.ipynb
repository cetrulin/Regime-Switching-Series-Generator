    "Example of a day trading algorithm which uses Machine Learning, specifically Support Vector Classification. If you want the regression version, here is that post.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this algo is not stable(performs poorly in other years as well as this one), I hope that it will serve as an example for implementing Machine Learning on Quantopian with an earnest focus on live trading. I also welcome suggestions and ideas to work toward a more reliable machine learning applications. The main issue being identifying ways to utilize more meaningful features(Technical Indicators or Fundamental daily data) than the noisy past prices used in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell me about the trading algo:\n",
    "- Using the scheduling functions, the algo has 3 steps every day( Predict in the morning and trade, fire sale before close, end any orders at close(paper trading requirement to prevent orders from carrying over to next day which cannot happen in live trading)\n",
    "- Uses the handle data function to enable a simple risk management: not allowing the cost basis of a position to deviate more than 1% from the 5 minute price average.\n",
    "- Intra day portfolio tracking and logging(see Getting Started Helper Functions post)\n",
    "- Can run on 1 stock, or a universe of stocks. It simply splits the available cash among the daily set of traded securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell me about the machine learning:\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine: performing classification to forecast the direction between the close and open price and group the results in BUY/SELL groups.\n",
    "- 5 Features: include the previous day's bar(open, close, high, low, volume).\n",
    "- Automatic model optimization(ish): a primitive grid search is used to determine a quick and messy fit of the SVM model parameters.\n",
    "- Feature Scaling: As used for SVM's and in general machine learning, all feature data, target data, and sample data have been transformed into a [-1, 1] range and have zero-mean with unit variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would appreciate any input, suggestions, or variations on this algo. I am hopeful that with with more features and proper risk management we can create a simple Machine Learning implementation that is profitable and low risk.\n",
    "I also have a similar implementation of this, but with regression, running as a website using yahoo daily data and about 6k stocks from the nyse, amex, and nasdaq and a 10 day regressions analysis is used to rank the best performing close forecast models:\n"
