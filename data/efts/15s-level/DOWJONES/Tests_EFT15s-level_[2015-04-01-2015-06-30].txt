TEST 1: False - The amount of records is correct?Approx mins of market should be: 1450800.0 and actual number is: 331292
TO-DO: Improve this test to be more acccurate.
TEST 2: False - Is the dataset complete? (no gaps at minute level).  1134899 gaps.
The max number of consecutive gaps at this level and this period is: 122 gaps.
A sample of the distribution of these consecutive gaps, sorted by descending order is:

Name: close, dtype: int32TEST 3: False - Are the resampled (at second level) and the original dataset of the same size? (so # rows is ok)
original_plus_gaps is:1466191 and resampled is: 88455780. If resampled is greater, it means gaps at second level (that may not be material at minute level).
TEST 4: True - Is the dataset free from any duplicates?
TEST 5: Number of market days (it should be an average of 251 market days a year +/-1 normally). # days is:64
