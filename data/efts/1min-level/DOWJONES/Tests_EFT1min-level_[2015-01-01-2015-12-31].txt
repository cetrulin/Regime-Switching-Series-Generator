TEST 1: False - The amount of records is correct?Approx mins of market should be: 5896800.0 and actual number is: 1594295
TO-DO: Improve this test to be more acccurate.
TEST 2: False - Is the dataset complete? (no gaps at minute level).  387 gaps.
The max number of consecutive gaps at this level and this period is: 99 gaps.
A sample of the distribution of these consecutive gaps, sorted by descending order is:

Name: close, dtype: int32TEST 3: False - Are the resampled (at second level) and the original dataset of the same size? (so # rows is ok)
original_plus_gaps is:1594682 and resampled is: 5911920. If resampled is greater, it means gaps at second level (that may not be material at minute level).
TEST 4: True - Is the dataset free from any duplicates?
TEST 5: Number of market days (it should be an average of 251 market days a year +/-1 normally). # days is:252
If any test fails, run quality checks.
